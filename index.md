# JAS
-----------


JAS  Programming Language   invented  and  modified  in  JDOLLAR(JWEB)  P.L  at  year  2016.

So  it  is   ranked   as   Rank Z'''''''''''''''''''''''''

JAS  is  like   OAK  Programming Language   is  parent  of   java.






JAS 
---

JAS   is  the   Programming Language   invented   by  wilmix  jemin j.

JAS   is    otherwise known as  JESUSCHRIST-ADVANCED-SYSTEM.

JAS  is a wisdom of christ.



Advantages:
----------

a)  JAS   is   a   Simplest  and   OOPS   Programming Language    behave  like WEB and CHDOLLAR.

b)  JAS  support  loosely   coupling..

c)  JAS   will  be   the  Next  generation Programming Language  which solves   complex  problems  than PHP.

d)  JAS  has Advanced   oops  concepts.

e)  JAS  also   supports  more   numerical  digits   than  any Programming Language .


f)  JAS  is  used  in  mobile  and  Web cloud  computing...


g)  JAS  also  used  in cloud  computing  Design.

h) JAS  saves   time  and  cost.

i)  JAS  also  has   Good  Design  and  Templates...

ar.add(15);
ar.add(1000);


for  (int  i=0;i<=ar.size()-1 ;i++)
JAS.out.println(""+ar.get(i));
JAS.out.println("");

GEN  i  = <NEW> GEN ();
  
 JAS.out.println(""+ i.display(10));

}

OUTPUT
------

Note:  JAS  technology  is   major reason  for inventing   any Programming Language to  be  deployed  in  cloud computing

with remotewebapplication.

So   JAS   is  the  most   powerful  Programming Language..  results  in  inventing  any  P.L

in   a  short  period  of  time  say  1 month or or  10 days  or  3  months  , etc.

C/C++   is  used  for  inventing   only  datastructures...
and  compiler 

JAS  Researchproject  period:  (2000- 2007; modified  in year  2013  and  2016}



Note:
======

It consists of 1000 modules related to Advanced Business which will be listed later.

JAS consists of 1 billion jsword AdvancedBusiness ; so JAS
is the most powerful Programming Language in the world and it is greater than any P.L.
