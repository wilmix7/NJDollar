# NJDollar
-----------

NJDollar   is a  Most  Advanced   Technology  than  JAS technology.

So  it  is   ranked   as   Rank Z'''''''''''''''''''''''''

JAS  is  like   OAK  technology   is  parent  of   java.

NJDOLLAR is  otherwise   known  as  JAS. 




JAS 
---

JAS   is  the   Technology   invented   by  wilmix  jemin j.

JAS   is    otherwise known as  JESUSCHRIST-ADVANCED-SYSTEM.

JAS  is a wisdom of christ.


Advantages:
----------

a)  JAS   is   a   Simplest  and   OOPS   Technology   behave  like CDollar and CHDOLLAR.

b)  JAS  support  loosely   coupling..

c)  JAS   will  be   the  Next  generation technology  which solves   complex  problems  than PHP.

d)  JAS  has Advanced   oops  concepts.

e)  JAS  also   supports  more   numerical  digits   than  any Technology.


f)  JAS  is  used  in  mobile  and  Web cloud  computing...


g)  JAS  also  used  in cloud  computing  Design.

h) JAS  saves   time  and  cost.

i)  JAS  also  has   Good  Design  and  Templates...

Note:  JAS  technology  is   major reason  for inventing   any  technology  basd  on  cloud computing.
So   JAS   is  the  most   powerful  technology..  results  in  inventing  any  technology

in   a  short  period  of  time  say  1 month or or  10 days  or  3  months  , etc.

C/C++   is  used  for  inventing   only  datastructures...
and  compiler  .  But   inventing   any  technology   in C/C++
takes   many  years  to complete  like   CDollar technology which   is    born  in  C/C++.

JAS  Researchproject  period:  (2000- 2007; modified  in year  2013  and  2016}
